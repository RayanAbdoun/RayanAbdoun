# 👋 Hey there, I’m ABDOUN Ahcene Rayan

🎓 I’m an AI engineering student at ENSIA Algiers (https://ensia.edu.dz), exploring the exciting world of artificial intelligence and its real-world applications.

Right now, I’m diving deep into topics like:

- 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- 🧠 Natural Language Processing (I love working with language models)  
- 👁️ Computer Vision (turning pixels into insights)  
- 💻 Building useful tools with Python, C++, and sometimes JavaScript

I’m always learning, building, and experimenting — whether it’s a class project, a side idea, or just trying to solve a problem I care about.
